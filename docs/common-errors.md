# Common client and server errors

Amadeus for Developers Self-Service APIs use HTTP status codes to communicate whether a request has been successfully processed.

## Types of errors

There two main types of errors are:

* **Client**:  typically occur when the request has not been properly built. 
* **Server**: occur when there is an issue on the server side.

## Client errors

If your API request is invalid, you will receive a `Client Error` response with an HTTP `4xx` status code. The body of the response will match the format defined in our `swagger` schema and provide details about the error.

### Authorization errors

**400 Bad request - Unsupported grant type**

Occurs when using a grant type other than `client credentials`. For more information, read our [Authorization Guide](../guides/authorization.md).

```json
{
    "error": "unsupported_grant_type",
    "error_description": "Only client_credentials value is allowed for the body parameter grant_type",
    "code": 38187,
    "title": "Invalid parameters"
}
```

**401 Unauthorized - Invalid access token**

Occurs when the access token provided in the Authorization header is expired or not longer valid. You must generate a new token.

```json
{
  "errors": [
      {
        "code": 38190,
        "title": "Invalid access token",
        "detail": "The access token provided in the Authorization header is invalid",
        "status": 401
      }
  ]
}
```


**401 Unauthorized -  Invalid client**

Occurs when the client credentials have an invalid format and are not recognized.

```json
{
    "error": "invalid_client",
    "error_description": "Client credentials are invalid",
    "code": 38187,
    "title": "Invalid parameters"
}
```

### Data Format Errors

**400 Bad request - Invalid format**

Occurs when an input query parameter is incorrect. In the example below, the Airport & City Search API returns an error because the location parameter is not in the expected IATA standard.

```json
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "status": 400,
            "code": 477,
            "title": "INVALID FORMAT",
            "detail": "City/Airport - 3 characters [IATA code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Air_Transport_Association_airport_code) from which the traveler will depart.",
            "source": {
                "parameter": "origin"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Resource Errors

**404 Not found - Resource not found**

Occurs when the endpoint or URL does not exist. Make sure you are calling a valid endpoint and that there are no spelling errors.

```json
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "code": 38196,
            "title": "Resource not found",
            "detail": "The targeted resource doesn't exist",
            "status": 404
        }
    ]
}
```

## Server errors

If an error occurs during the execution of your request, you will receive
a `Server error` resonse with an HTTP `5xx` status code. The body will match the defined error format, allowing your application to read it and display an appropriate message to the client. It may also contain debugging information which you can submit to us to further investigate the error.

**500 Internal error**

```json
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "code": 38189,
            "title": "Internal error",
            "detail": "An internal error occured, please contact your administrator",
            "status": 500
        }
    ]
}
```
