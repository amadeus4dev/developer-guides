# Amadeus for Developers Guides

This is the official Amadeus for Developer documentation reference, but there are more resources out there that might help you in your journey of using the APIs. Check them out!

* You can find all APIs reference and swaggers in our [API catalogue](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service). 
* Don’t forget to stop by our [GitHub workspace](https://github.com/amadeus4dev/) where you can find tons of samples and prototypes to get inspiration, as well as the latest version of the SDKs in several programming languages.
* If you are a happy Postman user, as we are, feel free to use the [Amadeus for Developers Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/amadeus4dev/workspace/amadeus-for-developers-s-public-workspace/documentation/2672636-27471449-d2ca-a8c4-1399-6b0cfbddd079).
