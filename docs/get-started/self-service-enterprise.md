# Self Service vs Enterprise
Amadeus for Developers includes two different offers: Self-Service and Enterprise, each meeting different customer needs.

## **Self-Service** 

Targets independent developers and start-ups that wish to connect to Amadeus APIs in a quick and easy manner. You can access and start to test these new REST/JSON APIs in less than 3 minutes, and get quick access to production data with a flexible pay-as-you-go pricing model. Please note that the catalog includes some selected APIs, although we will be constantly releasing new APIs.

Self-Service users have at their disposal detailed documentation, guides and SDKs, to help them solve any doubts they may have. 

## **Enterprise**  

Provides access to the full Amadeus APIs catalog, tailored to companies with scale needs and leading brands in the travel industry. Customers of Enterprise APIs receive dedicated support from their account managers and enjoy a customized pricing scheme to meet their needs. Please note that access to Enterprise APIs is only granted on a request basis, and some special requirements may apply. 

!!! warning
    You can potentially use APIs from both catalogs, but please keep in mind that the requirements and conditions of each offer are very different!
