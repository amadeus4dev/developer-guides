# Prototypes 

Would you like to explore the applications that you could build with Amadeus Self-Service APIs?
We have prototypes available in [Amadeus for Developers GitHub](https://github.com/amadeus4dev).

There are two types of prototypes (demo apps) available. 

* [Official prototypes](#amadeus-official-prototypes-or-demo-apps) are managed by Amadeus for Developers team and updated frequently to the latest version of APIs and SDKs. 
* [Community prototypes](#prototypes-from-community) are examples or demo apps that have been built and managed by developer community and it is not supported or maintained by Amadeus for Developers team. 


## Official Prototypes

### amadeus-flight-booking-django
amadeus-flight-booking-django ([Link to GitHub](https://github.com/amadeus4dev/amadeus-flight-booking-django){:target="\_blank"}) is built with Django and [Python SDK](../programming/python.md) and demonstrates the end-to-end flight booking process (Flight booking engine), which works in conjunction with three APIs: [Flight Offer Search API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/air/api-doc/flight-offers-search){:target="\_blank"}, [Flight Offer Price API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/air/api-doc/flight-offers-price){:target="\_blank"} and [Flight Create Orders API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/air/api-doc/flight-create-orders). 

It also uses [Airport & City Search API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/air/api-doc/airport-and-city-search){:target="\_blank"} to autocomplete the origin and destination with IATA code, and [Travel Restrictions API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/covid-19-and-travel-safety/api-doc/travel-restrictions){:target="\_blank"} to return COVID-19 travel restriction information for destination country.

### amadeus-trip-purpose-django

This project ([Link to GitHub](https://github.com/amadeus4dev-examples/amadeus-trip-purpose-django){:target="\_blank"}) demonstrates how to integrate Amadeus APIs using the [Python SDK](../programming/python.md) in a Django application. The end user submits round-trip information via a form and the [Trip Purpose Prediction](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/trip/api-doc/trip-purpose-prediction){:target="\_blank"} is called. This API predicts if the given journey is for leisure or business purposes.

###  amadeus-smart-flight-search-django
This prototype ([Link to GitHub](https://github.com/amadeus4dev-examples/amadeus-smart-flight-search-django){:target="\_blank"}) shows how the Air APIs can be integrated with the Django framework and [Python SDK](../programming/python.md), by calling the [Flight Choice Prediction](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/air/api-doc/flight-choice-prediction){:target="\_blank"} and [Trip Purpose Prediction](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/trip/api-doc/trip-purpose-prediction){:target="\_blank"}. We also call the [Flight Offers Search](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/air/api-doc/flight-offers-search){:target="\_blank"} as a more traditional method of flight search and we compare its results with the [Flight Choice Prediction](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/air/api-doc/flight-choice-prediction){:target="\_blank"} ones to show the power of AI.
