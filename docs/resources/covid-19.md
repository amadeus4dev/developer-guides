# COVID-19 and Travel Safety 



"Can I travel to South Korea? Thailand? or Costa Rica? Do I need to have a PCR test? before the flight? after I arrive? How many days of quarantine are required? Where can I find this information?" 

Don't worry, with Amadeus Self-Service APIs, you will be able to get detailed information on **number of COVID-19 cases, entry requirements, safety scores and a lot more** with some extra data about the searched destination using just one single API.

And even more, **safety information** can be retrieved for the destination you would like to visit so that you will be aware of where you are heading to. 



## Search by an area

There are two APIs to get this information: 

1. [Amadeus Travel Restrictions API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/covid-19-and-travel-safety/api-doc/travel-restrictions) for COVID-19 related information 
2. [Amadeus Safe Place API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/covid-19-and-travel-safety/api-doc/safe-place) for Safety information



[Travel Restrictions API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/covid-19-and-travel-safety/api-doc/travel-restrictions) can be searched **by a country, city, or region**. 

```bash
curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/duty-of-care/diseases/covid19-area-report?countryCode=FR&cityCode=PAR
```
!!! information
    The country code (2 letters) is defined by [ISO 3166](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) and the city code (3 letters) is defined by [IATA](https://www.iata.org/en/publications/directories/code-search/). You can also use [Airport & City Search API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/air) to get this information. 



[Safe Place API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/covid-19-and-travel-safety/api-doc/safe-place) can be searched by a given location with **latitude, longitude and radius**, or **Square information** (North, West, South, and East) or **by id**.

```bash
curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/safety/safety-rated-locations?latitude=48.856614&longitude=2.3522219&radius=2
```

```bash
curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/safety/safety-rated-locations/Q930400878
```

!!! information 
    **The id** is given by your first query which has been searched by others. The search by Id was designed to target a specific area that you want to focus on.



## Get information from responses
Let's highlight some information that you'll get from both Travel Restrictions API and Safe Place API. 

!!! Warning
    Don't forget that Amadeus for Developers provides a `Test Environment` with [limited data collections](https://amadeus4dev.github.io/developer-guides/guides/api-data-collection/). 

!!! information
     - Data for Travel Restrictions API comes from [Riskline](https://riskline.com/) and it has been sourced from local governments and media. The quantity of information provided may vary from country to country. 
     - Data for Safe Place API comes from [GeoSure](https://geosureglobal.com/) GeoSafeScores algorithm, which analyzes crime, health and economic data, official travel alerts, local reporting, and a variety of other sources. 
 

### Get summary of the destination + Safety score

From the response of Travel Restrictions API: 

```json
"area": {
            "name": "South Korea",
            "iataCode": "KR",
            "areaType": "Country"
        },
        "summary": "<p>Authorities have relied on gathering limits and social distancing measures to contain outbreaks since the start of the pandemic. A three-stage lifting of COVID-19 measures was underway but was paused in late November 2021 as a new spike in COVID-19 cases led to rises in deaths and those with severe symptoms, and threatened hospital beds and ICU availabilities. </p>",
        "diseaseRiskLevel": "High",
        "diseaseInfection": {
            "date": "2022-03-06",
            "level": "Extreme",
            "rate": 5088.42
```

From the response of Safe Place API, you will get an overall safety score and scores for six-component categories: 

- Women’s Safety 
- Health & Medical Safety 
- Physical Harm 
- Theft 
- Political Freedoms 
- LGBTQ+ Safety 

```json
            "subType": "CITY",
            "name": "Seoul",
            "geoCode": {
                "latitude": 37.566534999999995,
                "longitude": 126.97796899999999
            },
            "safetyScores": {
                "lgbtq": 45,
                "medical": 45,
                "overall": 35,
                "physicalHarm": 33,
                "politicalFreedom": 28,
                "theft": 44,
                "women": 34
            }
        }
```

**Safety scores range on a scale of 1-100, with 1 being the safest and 100 being the least safe.** In this example of Seoul, South Korea, a “politicalFreedom” score of 28 indicates that the potential for infringement of political rights or political unrest is less likely to happen at this location.  


### Get COVID-19 related statistics 

From the response of Travel Restrictions API: the result provides COVID-19 statistics such as total cases, active cases, and the current rate of infection per 100,000: 

```json

            "deaths": 9875,
            "confirmed": 5822626
        },
        "hotspots": "<p>Seoul, Incheon, Gyeonggi province</p>",
        "dataSources": {
