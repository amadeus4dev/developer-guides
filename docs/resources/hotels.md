## Search hotels

### Get a list of hotels by location 

First, users should be able to search hotels for a given location. The [Hotel List API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-list/api-reference){:target="\_blank"} returns a list of hotels based on a city, a geographic code or the unique Amadeus hotel Id. To answer a question, such as **"what are the hotels closed to the city hall?"** the `Hotel List API` has three endpoints to utilize based on your search criteria. It returns `hotel name`, `location`, and `hotel id` for you to proceed to the next steps of the hotel search. 

The [Hotel List API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-list/api-reference){:target="\_blank"} contains the following endpoints:

* `GET ​/reference-data​/locations​/hotels​/by-city` - searches hotels by a city code
* `GET ​/reference-data​/locations​/hotels​/by-geocode` - searches hotels by geographic coordinates
* `GET /reference-data​/locations​/hotels​/by-hotels` - searches hotels by a unique Amadeus hotel Id


#### Search hotels by a city  

You can specify an [IATA city code](https://www.iata.org/en/publications/directories/code-search/){:target="\_blank"} or Geocode to search a more specific area to get the list of hotels. You can customize the request using parameters, such as radius, chain code, amenities, star ratings, and hotel source. 

To search a hotel by a city code, the IATA city code is the only required query parameter:

```bash
GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/hotels/by-city?cityCode=PAR
```

To include places within a certain radius of the queried city, you can use the optional `radius` parameter in conjunction with the `radiusUnit` parameter that defines the unit of measurement for the radius. For example, to look for places within 100 km from Paris:

```bash
GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/hotels/by-city?cityCode=PAR&radius=100&radiusUnit=KM
```

Another way to narrow down our search query is to limit the search to a specific hotel chain. To do this, we need to pass the hotel chain code (which is a two letters string) as the `chainCodes` parameter, such as EM for Marriott:

```bash
GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/hotels/by-city?cityCode=PAR&chainCodes=EM
```

If you are looking for hotels with certain amenities, such as a spa or a swimming pool, you can use the `amenities` parameter, which is an enum with the following options:

* FITNESS_CENTER
* AIR_CONDITIONING
* RESTAURANT
* PARKING
* PETS_ALLOWED
* AIRPORT_SHUTTLE
* BUSINESS_CENTER
* DISABLED_FACILITIES
* WIFI
* MEETING_ROOMS
* NO_KID_ALLOWED
* TENNIS
* GOLF
* KITCHEN
* ANIMAL_WATCHING
* BABY-SITTING
* BEACH
* CASINO
* JACUZZI
* SAUNA
* SOLARIUM
* MASSAGE
* VALET_PARKING
* BAR or LOUNGE
* KIDS_WELCOME
* NO_PORN_FILMS
* MINIBAR
* TELEVISION
* WI-FI_IN_ROOM
* ROOM_SERVICE
* GUARDED_PARKG
* SERV_SPEC_MENU

The query to find a hotel in Paris with a swimming pool will look like this:

```bash
GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/hotels/by-city?cityCode=PAR&chainCodes=&amenities=SWIMMING_POOL
```

If stars rating is important for the search, you can include up to four values separated by comma in the `ratings` parameter:

```bash
GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/hotels/by-city?cityCode=PAR&ratings=5
```


The source data for the [Hotel List API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-list/api-reference){:target="\_blank"} comes from BEDBANK for aggregators and DIRECTCHAIN for GDS/Distribution. You can select both sources or include/ exclude a particular source:

```bash
GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/hotels/by-city?cityCode=PAR&hotelSource=ALL
```


The response will also include a dedicated Amadeus `hotelId`:

```json
        {
            "chainCode": "AC",
            "iataCode": "PAR",
            "dupeId": 700169556,
            "name": "ACROPOLIS HOTEL PARIS BOULOGNE",
            "hotelId": "ACPARH29",
            "geoCode": {
                "latitude": 48.83593,
                "longitude": 2.24922
            },
            "address": {
                "countryCode": "FR"
            },
            "lastUpdate": "2022-03-01T15:22:17"
        }
```


#### Search hotels by Geocode 

Using the `by-geocode` endpoint, get a list of hotels in Paris (latitude=41.397158 and longitude=2.160873):

```bash
GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/hotels/by-geocode?latitude=41.397158&longitude=2.160873
```

To include places within a certain radius of the queried city, you can use the optional `radius` parameter in conjunction with the `radiusUnit` parameter that defines the unit of measurement for the radius. For example, to look for places within 100 km from Paris:

```bash
GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/hotels/by-geocode?latitude=41.397158&longitude=2.160873&radius=100&radiusUnit=KM
```

Another way to narrow down our search query is to limit the search to a specific hotel chain. To do this, we need to pass the hotel chain code (which is a two letters string) as the `chainCodes` parameter, such as EM for Marriott:

```bash
GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/hotels/by-geocode?latitude=41.397158&longitude=2.160873&chainCodes=EM
```

If you are looking for hotels with certain amenities, such as a spa or a swimming pool, you can use the `amenities` parameter, which is an enum with the following options:

* FITNESS_CENTER

* BUSINESS_CENTER
* DISABLED_FACILITIES
* WIFI

```bash
GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/hotels/by-geocode?latitude=41.397158&longitude=2.160873&chainCodes=&amenities=SWIMMING_POOL&ratings=
```

If stars rating is important for the search, you can include up to four values separated by comma in the `ratings` parameter:

```bash

```


The response will also include a dedicated Amadeus `hotelId`:

```json
        {
            "chainCode": "AC",
            "iataCode": "PAR",
            "dupeId": 700169556,

            },
            "lastUpdate": "2022-03-01T15:22:17"
        }
```


#### Search hotels by hotel ids

If you already know the Id of a hotel that you would like to check, you can use it to call the [Hotel List API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-list/api-reference){:target="\_blank"}. 

```bash
GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/hotels/by-hotels?hotelIds=ACPARF58
```

### Interactive code examples 

Check out this [interactive code example](../examples/live-examples.md) which provides a hotel search form to help you build your app. You can easily customize it and use the Hotel Search API to get the cheapest flight offers.

### Autocomplete Hotel Names

Your application can also display a list of suggested hotel names based on keywords used in the search query. 

[Hotel Name Autocomplete API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-name-autocomplete/api-reference){:target="\_blank"} provides a list of up to 20 hotels whose names most closely match the search query string. For each hotel in the results, the API also provides descriptive data, including the hotel name, address, geocode, property type, IATA hotel code and the Amadeus hotel ID. 

The two mandatory query parameters for this API are the `keyword` and `subtype`. The keyword can be anything from four to fourty letters. The sub type is the category of search, which can be either `HOTEL_LEISURE` to target aggregators or `HOTEL_GDS` to target the chains directly.


```bash
GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/hotel?keyword=PARI&subType=HOTEL_LEISURE
```

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "id": 2969353,
            "name": "BEST WESTERN PREMIER OPERA FAUBOURG PARI",
            "iataCode": "PAR",
            "subType": "HOTEL_LEISURE",
            "relevance": 70,
            "type": "location",
            "hotelIds": [
                "TEPARCFG"
            ],
            "address": {
                "cityName": "PARIS",
                "countryCode": "FR"
            },
            "geoCode": {
                "latitude": 48.86821,
                "longitude": 2.40085
            }
        },
        {
            "id": 3012697,
            "name": "HOTEL PARI MAHAL",
            "iataCode": "SXR",
            "subType": "HOTEL_LEISURE",
            "relevance": 70,
            "type": "location",
            "hotelIds": [
                "TKSXRAHS"
            ],
            "address": {
                "cityName": "SRINAGAR",
                "countryCode": "IN"
            },
            "geoCode": {
                "latitude": 34.08106,
                "longitude": 74.83126
            }
        },

```

We can narrow the search down to a country specified by a code in the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format:

```bash
GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/hotel?keyword=PARI&subType=HOTEL_LEISURE&countryCode=FR
```

We can request the results in various languages, although if a language is not supported, the results will be shown in English by default:

```bash
GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/hotel?keyword=PARI&subType=HOTEL_LEISURE&lang=FR
```

We can also define the maximum number of results by using the `max` parameter:

```bash
GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/hotel?keyword=PARI&subType=HOTEL_LEISURE&countryCode=FR&lang=EN&max=20
```

### Display Hotel Ratings

When users search for hotels in a desired area, they may wonder about the hotel rating. [Hotel Ratings API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-ratings/api-reference){:target="\_blank"} returns ratings for many crucial elements of a hotel, such as sleep quality, services, facilities, room comfort, value for money, location and many others. [Hotel Ratings API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-ratings/api-reference){:target="\_blank"} guarantees high-quality service for your customers.

The sentiment analysis, just like the one below, is displayed in a simple flow to allow you to easily identify the best hotels based on traveler reviews:

```bash
GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/e-reputation/hotel-sentiments?hotelIds=TELONMFS,ADNYCCTB,XXXYYY01
```

```json
{ "data": [  {
    "type": "hotelSentiment",
    "numberOfReviews": 218,
    "numberOfRatings": 278,
   "hotelId": "ADNYCCTB",
    "overallRating": 93,
    "sentiments": {
      "sleepQuality": 87,
      "service": 98,
      "facilities": 90,
      "roomComforts": 92,
      "valueForMoney": 87,
      "catering": 89,
      "location": 98,
      "pointsOfInterest": 91,
      "staff": 100
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "hotelSentiment",
    "numberOfReviews": 2667,
    "numberOfRatings": 2666,
    "hotelId": "TELONMFS",
    "overallRating": 81,
    "sentiments": {
      "sleepQuality": 78,
      "service": 80,
      "facilities": 75,
      "roomComforts": 87,
      "valueForMoney": 75,
      "catering": 81,
     "location": 89,
      "internet": 72,
      "pointsOfInterest": 81,
      "staff": 89
    }
  }
]
```

With these additional filters, your booking process becomes more efficient and you can offer your customers an enriched shopping experience. In this way, you can be confident that you are offering a highly rated hotels selection in the areas that customers appreciate the most.


## Check Availabilities and Prices

Once users have explored the list of hotels in their desired area, they would want to check the price of a specific hotel or compare the prices of hotels on the list. With the `hotelIds` that you got from [Hotel List API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-list/api-reference){:target="\_blank"}, you now can check the available rooms with real-time prices and room descriptions by calling the [Hotel Search API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-search/api-reference){:target="\_blank"}. 

An example to request available rooms and prices for one room in Hilton Paris Opera for one adult with check-in date 2022-11-22:

```bash
GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v3/shopping/hotel-offers?hotelIds=HLPAR266&adults=1&checkInDate=2022-11-22&roomQuantity=1
```

The API returns a list of `offers` objects containing the price of the cheapest available room as well as information including the room description and payment policy. 

!!! Note
    The response of `Hotel Search V3` contains real-time data, so you don't need an additional validation step anymore. However, as there are thousands of people reserving hotels at any given second, the availability of a given room may change between the moment you search and the moment you decide to book. It is therefore advised that you proceed with booking **as soon as possible** or **add a validation step** by searching by `offerid` described below.

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "type": "hotel-offers",
            "hotel": {
                "type": "hotel",

        }
    ]
}

```
!!! information
    The commission information returned by the `commission` parameter is for information only. Hotels can voluntary provide commission. They are only obliged to do it if you are a IATA certified travel agency, in which case you need to [contact](https://developers.amadeus.com/support/contact-us-self-service) our Enterprise APIs team to get access to our REST/JSON booking APIs. Once you have moved to the [production environment](../API-Keys/moving-to-production.md) and obtained the offerId, it will be necessary for you to directly communicate with the hotel to receive the commission on this offer.

If the time between displaying prices and booking the room is long enough to allow others to book the same room, you can consider requesting [Hotel Search API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-search/api-reference){:target="\_blank"} again with the `offerid` that you got before. This is not mandatory as you always will see if the offer is available or not when you try to book the offer.

An example to request the offer information with `offer id`: 

```bash
GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v3/shopping/hotel-offers/ZBC0IYFMFV
```

Now that you have found the available offer (and its `offerId`) with the price, you're ready to book! 


## Booking the Hotel

The [Hotel Booking API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-booking/api-reference){:target="\_blank"} is the final step in the hotel booking flow. By making a `POST` request with the offer Id returned by the Hotel Search API, the guest information, and the payment information, you can create a booking directly in the hotel reservation system. 

```bash
POST https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/booking/hotel-bookings \
{
  "data": {
    "offerId": "ZBC0IYFMFV",
    "guests": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": {
          "title": "MR",
          "firstName": "BOB",
          "lastName": "SMITH"
        },
        "contact": {
          "phone": "+33679278416",
          "email": "bob.smith@email.com"
        }
      }
    ],
    "payments": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "method": "creditCard",
        "card": {
          "vendorCode": "VI",
          "cardNumber": "4151289722471370",
          "expiryDate": "2023-08"
        }
      }
    ],
    "rooms": [
      {
        "guestIds": [
          1
        ],
        "paymentId": 1,
        "specialRequest": "I will arrive at midnight"
      }
    ]
  }
}'
```

Congratulations! You’ve just performed your first hotel booking! Once the reservation is made, the API will return **a unique booking confirmation ID** which you can send to your users. 

### Notes about Payment

The Hotel Search API returns information about the payment policy of each hotel. The main policy types are: 

- **Guarantee**: the hotel will save credit card information during booking but not make any charges to the account. In the case of a no-show or out-of-policy cancellation, the hotel may charge penalties to the card. 
- **Deposit**: at the time of booking or by a given deadline, the hotel will charge the guest a percentage of the total amount of the reservation. The remaining amount is paid by the traveler directly at the hotel. 
- **Prepay**: the total amount of the reservation fee must be paid by the traveler when making the booking. 

The current version of the [Hotel Booking API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-booking/api-reference){:target="\_blank"} only permits booking at hotels that accept credit cards. During the booking process, Amadeus passes the payment and guest information to the hotel but does not validate this information. Be sure to validate the payment and guest information, as invalid information may result in the reservation being canceled. 

As soon as your application stores transmits, or processes cardholder information, you will need to comply with PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). For more information, visit the [PCI Security Council website](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/merchants){:target="\_blank"}. 


## Guide for multiple hotel rooms

Now that we have gone through the hotel booking flow, you may wonder how to proceed to booking more than two rooms in a hotel. 

### Check availability and prices for multiple rooms 

The first step to booking multiple rooms is to search for hotels in your destination with the desired number of available rooms. You can do this by specifying the `roomQuantity` parameter when you call the [Hotel Search API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-search/api-reference){:target="\_blank"} using the `hotelid` that you got from the [Hotel List API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-list/api-reference){:target="\_blank"}. 

Here is an example of a search in Hilton Paris for **two rooms** for **three adults**: 

```bash
GET https://test.api.amadeus.com/v3/shopping/hotel-offers?hotelIds=HLPAR266&adults=3&checkInDate=2022-11-22&roomQuantity=2
```

The API will then return the available offers where `roomQuantity`is equal to 2.

```json
 "offers": [ 
            { 
                "id": "48E6C8C7DAA0BA5C22663E2A2A2B7629F5468BCBE2722FE4AB8174", 
                "roomQuantity": "2", 
                "checkInDate": "2022-11-22", 
                "checkOutDate": "2022-11-23",
```

!!! information
    The current version of the Hotel Search API returns the price per room. To get the total price of a reservation for multiple rooms, you must multiply the price by `roomQuantity`. 

### Book multiple rooms with details for one guest

To call the [Hotel Booking API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-booking/api-reference){:target="\_blank"}, you must provide details for at least one guest per offer (the offer contains all rooms for the reservation). For example, the JSON query below details a request for one guest to book two rooms using `offerId`: 

```json
{ 
   "data":{ 
      "offerId":"F837D841218665647003CC9A8CA2A37CEC7276BBE14F9B9C525FBD1B7B69A8FF", 
      "guests":[ 
         { 
            "name":{ 
               "title":"MR", 
               "firstName":"BOB", 
               "lastName":"SMITH" 
            }, 
            "contact":{ 
               "phone":"+33679278416", 
               "email":"bob.smith@email.com" 
            } 
         } 
      ], 
      "payments":[ 
         { 
            "method":"creditCard", 
            "card":{ 
               "vendorCode":"VI", 
               "cardNumber":"4111111111111111", 
               "expiryDate":"2026-01" 
            } 
         } 
      ] 
   } 
} 
```
Once the booking is complete, the API will return the following confirmation:

```json
{ 
    "data": [ 
        { 
            "type": "hotel-booking", 
            "id": "HA_36000507", 
            "providerConfirmationId": "36000507", 
            "associatedRecords": [ 
                { 
                    "reference": "R622XL", 
                    "originSystemCode": "GDS" 
                } 
            ] 
        }, 
        { 
            "type": "hotel-booking", 
            "id": "HA_36000506", 
            "providerConfirmationId": "36000506", 
            "associatedRecords": [ 
                { 
                    "reference": "R622XL", 
                    "originSystemCode": "GDS" 
                } 
            ] 
        } 
    ] 
}
```

### Book multiple rooms with guest distribution

One common question is how to assign guest distribution among the booked rooms. 

When you call the [Hotel Booking API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-booking/api-reference){:target="\_blank"}, the `rooms` object represents the rooms. Each room contains guests distributed per room. Specifically, each `room` object needs IDs of the guests staying in that room.  

Below is a sample request to book two rooms with guest distribution. The first room is for guest ID’s `1` & `2` and the second room for guest Id `3`.

```json

{ 
  "data": { 
    "offerId": "4A449AE835DD68F2E7C3571740FD00B76209D7311E719E3B66DE4E1100", 
    "guests": [ 
      { 
        "id": 1, 
        "name": { 
          "title": "MR", 
          "firstName": "BOB", 
          "lastName": "SMITH" 
        }, 
        "contact": { 
          "phone": "+33679278416", 
          "email": "bob.smith@email.com" 
        } 
      }, 
      { 
        "id": 2, 
        "name": { 
          "title": "MRS", 
          "firstName": "EMILY", 
          "lastName": "SMITH" 
        }, 
        "contact": { 
          "phone": "+33679278416", 
          "email": "bob.smith@email.com" 
        } 
      }, 
      { 
        "id": 3, 
        "name": { 
          "firstName": "JOHNY", 
          "lastName": "SMITH" 
        }, 
        "contact": { 
          "phone": "+33679278416", 
          "email": "bob.smith@email.com" 
        } 
      } 
    ], 
    "payments": [ 
      { 
        "id": 1, 
        "method": "creditCard", 
        "card": { 
          "vendorCode": "VI", 
          "cardNumber": "4151289722471370", 
          "expiryDate": "2026-08" 
        } 
      } 
    ], 
    "rooms": [ 
      { 
        "guestIds": [ 
          1, 2 
        ], 
        "paymentId": 1, 
        "specialRequest": "I will arrive at midnight" 
      }, 
      { 
        "guestIds": [ 
          3 
        ], 
        "paymentId": 1, 
        "specialRequest": "I will arrive at midnight" 
      } 
    ] 
  } 
} 
```

The API response will be the same as when you booked multiple rooms using the details of just one guest:

```json
{ 
    "data": [ 
        { 
            "type": "hotel-booking", 
            "id": "XK_88803316", 
            "providerConfirmationId": "88803316", 
            "associatedRecords": [ 
                { 
                    "reference": "MJ6HLK", 
                    "originSystemCode": "GDS" 
                } 
            ] 
        }, 
        { 
            "type": "hotel-booking", 
            "id": "XK_88803315", 
            "providerConfirmationId": "88803315", 
            "associatedRecords": [ 
                { 
                    "reference": "MJ6HLK", 
                    "originSystemCode": "GDS" 
                } 
            ] 
        } 
    ]​ 
```

## Common Errors

### AcceptedPayments must be creditCards 

The current version of the [Hotel Booking API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-booking/api-reference){:target="\_blank"} only supports credit card payments, which are accepted by most hotels. The [Hotel Search API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-search/api-reference){:target="\_blank"} returns the payment policy of each hotel under `acceptedPayments` in the policies section.

###  Empty response from the View Room endpoint  

If you get an empty response from the Hotel Search API’s second endpoint, then the hotel is fully booked and has no vacancy for the requested dates. If you don't use the `checkInDate` and `checkOutDate` parameters in the request, the API will return results for a one-night stay starting on the current date. If the hotel is full, the response will be empty. 

### No rooms available at requested property

```json
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "status": 400,
            "code": 3664,
            "title": "NO ROOMS AVAILABLE AT REQUESTED PROPERTY"
        }
    ]
}
```

The offer for the selected Hotel is no longer available. Please select a new one.
