# Cars and Transfers

The Amadeus Cars and Transfers APIs provide an extensive suite of capabilities designed to simplify the process of booking and managing transfers during a traveler's trip, delivering a seamless and efficient experience.

Have a look at our dedicated [Postman collection](../developer-tools/postman.md) to easily test the Cars and Transfers API with pre-set requests.

| [Transfer Search](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/cars-and-transfers/api-doc/transfer-search/api-reference){:target="\_blank"}     | This API enables users to search for a transfer using a range of pre-arranged transportation options. These options include Private Transfers, Hourly Services, Taxis, Shared Transfers, Airport Express trains and buses, Private Jets, and Helicopter Transfers.                                                 |
| [Transfer Booking](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/cars-and-transfers/api-doc/transfer-booking){:target="\_blank"} | Once a transfer is chosen, the Transfer Booking API completes the reservation. It provides a unique booking ID and reservation details, which can be used to manage the reservation later. |
| [Transfer Management](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/cars-and-transfers/api-doc/transfer-management){:target="\_blank"} | This API provides tools for managing transfer reservations. Using the booking ID provided by the Transfer Booking API, users can cancel reservations. |


## Search for a transfer

The search is carried out through a POST API call to `/shopping/transfer-offers`. The API request includes parameters like the start and end locations, type of transfer, number of passengers, provider codes, and other optional parameters.


In the following example request, we have multiple parameters each with its own specific meaning and structure:

* `startLocationCode`: "CDG" - This is an International Air Transport Association (IATA) airport code which represents Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France. The starting location of the journey.

* `endAddressLine`: "Avenue Anatole France, 5" - This is the exact address where the journey will end, presumably a location in Paris.

* `endCityName`: "Paris" - The city where the journey ends.

* `endZipCode`: "75007" - This represents the postal code of the end location.

* `endCountryCode`: "FR" - It's a two-letter country code representing France.

* `endName`: "Souvenirs De La Tour" - The name of the destination, perhaps a business or venue at the end location.

* `endGooglePlaceId`: "ChIJL-DOWeBv5kcRfTbh97PimNc" - A unique identifier that Google assigns to a location. You can use it to get more details about this location using Google's Places API.

* `endGeoCode`: "48.859466,2.2976965" - The geographical coordinates of the end location. The first number is latitude and the second is longitude.

* `transferType`: "PRIVATE" - This indicates that the transfer type is private, meaning the transfer will not be shared with others. This value is the Amadeus transfer service type, which can take one of the following:

  - *PRIVATE*: Private transfer from point to point
  - *SHARED*: Shared transfer from point to point
  - *TAXI*: Taxi reservation from point to point, price is estimated
  - *HOURLY*: Chauffeured driven transfer per hour
  - *AIRPORT_EXPRESS*: Express Train from/to Airport
  - *AIRPORT_BUS*: Express Bus from/to Airport
  - *HELICOPTER*: Private helicopter flight from/to airport
  - *PRIVATE_JET*: Private flight from airport to airport

* `startDateTime`: "2021-11-10T10:30:00" - The ISO 8601 timestamp when the journey begins.

* `providerCodes`: "TXO" - The code representing the provider of the transfer service.

* `passengers`: 2 - The total number of passengers who will take the journey.

* `stopOvers`: This is an array of objects representing different stopovers on the journey. Each object includes details about the duration of the stopover, the sequence number (which stopover it is), and information about the stopover's address, country code, city name, zip code, Google place ID, name, and geographical coordinates. For example, a `stopOver` object might look like this:

```json
{
  "duration": "PT2H30M",
  "sequenceNumber": 1,
  "addressLine": "Avenue de la Bourdonnais, 19",
  "countryCode": "FR",
  "cityName": "Paris",
  "zipCode": "75007",
  "googlePlaceId": "DOWeBv5kcRfTbh97PimN",
  "name": "De La Tours",
  "geoCode": "48.859477,2.2976985",
  "stateCode": "FR"
}
```

* `startConnectedSegment`: This object contains information about a connected transportation segment, like a flight, that leads to the start of this transfer. It includes details about the transportation type, transportation number, and the departure and arrival of this segment.

* `passengerCharacteristics`: This array of objects includes details about the passengers' type codes and their ages. For example, "ADT" stands for an adult passenger and "CHD" stands for a child passenger.


```json
{
  "startLocationCode": "CDG",
  ...
  "endGeoCode": "48.859466,2.2976965",
  "transferType": "PRIVATE",
  ...
  "passengers": 2,
  "stopOvers": [
    {
      "duration": "PT2H30M",
      "sequenceNumber": 1,
      ...
      "stateCode": "FR"
    }
  ],
  ...
  "passengerCharacteristics": [
    {
      "passengerTypeCode": "ADT",
      "age": 20
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

This request initiates a search for a private transfer for two passengers from location CDG with specific passenger characteristics and other details.

Let's have a look at the response:

## Booking a transfer

Let's now look into the [Transfer Booking API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/cars-and-transfers/api-doc/transfer-booking){:target="\_blank"}.

The main endpoint URL is `https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/ordering/transfer-orders?offerId=<OFFER_ID>`. The parameter `<OFFER_ID>` needs to be replaced with the actual ID of the offer you wish to order, such as `0cb11574-4a02-11e8-842f-0ed5f89f718b`, which we obtained in our previous example.

## Cancelling a transfer

The [Transfer Management API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/cars-and-transfers/api-doc/transfer-management){:target="\_blank"} effectively allows us to cancel a transfer linked with an existing order.

For example:

```bash
POST https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/ordering/transfer-orders/<orderId>/transfers/cancellation
```

Replace the `<orderId>` with the unique identifier of the order that was previously generated when the order was created. For instance, the `orderId` could be something like `0cb11574-4a02-11e8-842f-0ed5f89f718b`.

The `confirmNbr` is a unique confirmation number associated with the transfer that is to be cancelled. 

The response for this request will confirm the cancellation of the transfer. Here's an example response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "confirmNbr": "2904892",
    "reservationStatus": "CANCELLED"
  }
}
```

In this example response, we see the `confirmNbr` `2904892` and the reservationStatus `CANCELLED`, confirming that the cancellation has been successful.
