title: Hotel Search API Migration Guide
---

Are you still using the old version of the [Hotel Search API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-search){:target="\_blank"}? This guide will help you migrate to the new version of the [Hotel Search API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-search){:target="\_blank"} and leverage its advantages right from the start.

## How is the Hotel Search API v3 different to v2.1?

The main difference between the two API versions is that the v2.1 endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers/by-hotel` has been integrated into the v3 `/shopping/hotel-offers/ endpoint`. All hotel offers in the Hotel Search v3 are now queried by hotel’s unique Amadeus Id, which renders the v2.1 endpoint `/shopping/hotel-offers/by-hotel` obsolete.

We also have a new API to help you ensure a seamless migration – the [Hotel List API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-list){:target="\_blank"}. This API returns a list of hotels by a unique Amadeus hotel Id, IATA city code or geographic coordinates.

The diagram below shows a high-level overview of the differences between the [Hotel Search API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-search){:target="\_blank"} v2.1 and v3.

## FAQ

-	How can I get the hotel image/address/contact details/rating/amenities?
    *	Due to legal constraints we, unfortunately, can no longer distribute hotel images and specific details through our Self-Service APIs. 
    *	As a workaround we recommend using [Leonardo](https://www.leonardoworldwide.com/){:target="\_blank"}, our trusted data provider.
    *	Also, we have built some Python tutorials about how to get the [hotel address](https://github.com/amadeus4dev/amadeus-hotel-address-python/){:target="\_blank"} using geocoding APIs and Google Place APIs and how to get the [hotel images](https://github.com/amadeus4dev/amadeus-hotel-images-python/){:target="\_blank"} with Google Places API. You should be able to adapt them in your own programming language easily.

-	How can I use the data without the cache data control?
    * The [Hotel Search API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-search){:target="\_blank"} v3 is using live data directly while avoiding the need to build cache and add any extra validation mechanisms to the data.

-	How do I get the hotel rating?
    * We offer data on hotel rating via our Hotel Rating API. Please bear in mind that this rating information is based on the sentiment analysis and not the star rating system. You can, however, retrieve a list of hotels by their star rating using the [Hotel List API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-list){:target="\_blank"} with the required star rating as an additional query parameter.
