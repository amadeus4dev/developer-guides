# Pricing options for Amadeus Travel APIs

Amadeus for Developers provides two environments: test and production. 

The `test` environment is the default environment for all new applications with access to a subset of the real data. This is where you will enjoy free request quota each month to build and test your apps.

The `production` environment gives you access to the full real-time data. When you move to production, you maintain your monthly free request quota and pay only for the additional calls you make.
